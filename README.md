# hello-world

Hello! My name is LWaldrop643. As of writing this, I am a second-year computer science student at Edinboro University (soon to be PennWest: Edinboro)
I am starting my GitHub experience now as a place to store my projects while moving between devices, and to catalogue my journey in game development.
Other than computer science, I love video games, astronomy, robots, and my girlfriend M.

If you would like to reach out to me, feel free to email me at luc.n.wal.643@gmail.com
